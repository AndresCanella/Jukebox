# Jukebox

Jukebox is a simple component made for playing local and remote audio files which provides the logic for the most common playback options like ``play``, ``pause``, ``stop``, ``replay``, ``next``, ``previous`` and ``volume control``. In addition, it lets you ``seek to a certain second`` within an audio file.

**Most importantly,** Jukebox is **not a visual control**, it only provides the logic for playing and interacting with audio files. <i>Even though it doesn't provide any UI controls, the example project contains a basic visual player which has been nicely integrated with the interface Jukebox exposes.</i>
